A couple of custom TextMate themes.


## Gruber Dark

Derived from the [BBEdit Theme](http://daringfireball.net/projects/bbcolors/schemes/)
of the same name. Original text formatting was 10 point Monaco with no antialiasing.



## Dekorte

Based on the XCode theme of [Steven Dekorte](http://dekorte.com/blog/blog.cgi).
Original text formatting was 13 point Courier with no antialiasing.


## Sunset

Based on the XCode Sunset theme. This is the theme that I'm currently using.


## TODO

The syntax highlighting needs extended for additional syntax elements
(markdown, diffs, etc.) Contributions more than welcome.
